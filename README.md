# Love at First Flight - Travel Tracker - Mod 2 Final

## Abstract
Love at First Flight is a tracker app which allows users to track their travel. Users are able to log in using a name and password, after which they are directed to a dashboard which displays all of their travel. Users are greeted with a display of all of their trips, as well as a total sum of the money they’ve spent on trips so far that year. Users are able to sort their trips by category: past, present, upcoming and pending. They are able to request a quote for a new trip by selecting a destination, trip start date, trip duration and number of travelers. Users are able to request the trip, upon which the new trip they’ve built will be placed into their “pending trips.”
